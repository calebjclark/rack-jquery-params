rack-jquery-params
===========

A Rack middleware that bridges the discrepancy between jQuery.param and how Rack parses nested params within query
strings and post bodies.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rack-jquery-params.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rack-jquery-params)

If you use jQuery's get, post, put, or ajax methods then jQuery.param is run on your data. The problem is that jQuery.param
turns this javascript object:

 ```
 {test: [{this_is_an_object_inside_an_array:'yes'}]}
 ```

into a query string that Rack cannot read correctly:

```
test[0][this_is_an_object_inside_an_array]=yes
```

Rack expects all arrays to be sent as empty brackets (i.e., "test[]"). It parses jQuery's "test[0]" as a hash, resulting
in the following params:

```ruby
{
    :test => {
        :0 => {
            :this_is_an_object_inside_an_array => 'yes'
        }
    }
}
```

This gem fixes the above params and converts it to:

```ruby
{
    :test => [
        {
            :this_is_an_object_inside_an_array => 'yes'
        }
    ]
}
```

## Setting Up JSONR

Install the gem:

```ruby
gem install rack-jquery-params
```

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rack-jquery-params', :require => 'rack/jquery-params'
```

Activate by including it your config.ru file:

```ruby
use Rack::JQueryParams
run Sinatra::Application
```

## Options

By default the JQueryParams fix is applied to all http methods, however you can change this functionality by setting
the applies_to option with your chosen http method:

```ruby
use Rack::JQueryParams, :applies_to => :get
```

 You can also set applies_to to be an array of http methods:

```ruby
use Rack::JQueryParams, :applies_to => [:get, :put, :delete]
```
